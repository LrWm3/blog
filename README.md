# Introduction

This is a collection of design documents, formerly maintained in various
different locations and formats, now grouped together and converted
to commonmark.

# Contributing

## Style

We will follow the commonmark specification.

We *should* try to follow this
[style guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/#about),
but are still [evaluating solutions](https://github.com/jgm/cmark/issues/131)
for *stable* automatic formatting.

80 columns line width is thus not yet enforced, but strongly suggested.

# Build the documentation

## Install dependencies

* Follow [hotdoc's installation guide](https://hotdoc.github.io/installing.html),
  preferably in a virtualenv.

* We *experimentally* use the hotdoc C extension to include functions by
  name, follow the steps outlined [here](https://github.com/hotdoc/hotdoc_c_extension)
